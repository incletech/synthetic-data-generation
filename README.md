# Synthetic Data Generation for Function Calling

## Overview

This project focuses on generating synthetic data for function calls in order to test and develop machine learning models, natural language processing systems, or any other AI agents that require functional inputs. The primary aim is to create realistic, diverse, and contextually meaningful synthetic data for validating different applications or algorithms.

## Features

- Generate various types of synthetic function call data
- Support for custom data schemas
- Configurable to generate specific data types and patterns
- Useful for training, testing, and validating machine learning models or APIs
- High customization for different function signatures and scenarios

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
